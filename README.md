## 🚧 Section 2: Project Progress
### 🔐 2.0 – Security: Requirements
| **Security Requirement**                                                      | Status   | **Description**                                                                                                                                          |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Password Hashing**                                                          | ⬜       | Any password stored in your database must be **hashed** (e.g., using bcrypt, Argon2).                                                                   |
| **Protection Against SQL Injection and XSS**                                  | ✅       | The website must be protected against **SQL injection** and **XSS attacks** (e.g., using prepared statements and input sanitization).                   |
| **HTTPS/WSS Required**                                                        | ✅       | All communication (frontend/backend, API, WebSocket) must use **HTTPS/WSS** to ensure secure data transmission.                                        |
| **Form and Input Validation**                                                 | ⬜       | You must implement **validation for all forms and user inputs**, either on the frontend (if no backend is used) or on the server side.                 |
| **Route and API Security**                                                    | ⬜       | Even without implementing JWT or 2FA, all **API routes and access points must be secured**. Website security is a top priority regardless of method.   |
